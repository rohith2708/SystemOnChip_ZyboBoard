# SystemOnChip_ZyboBoard
to add a peripheral to the ARM core on the Z-Board/Zybo FPGA. The peripherals are 32x 32 bit registers which are readable and writeable. One register drives LEDs and an other receives inputs fron switches/buttons. The connection between the ARM and the register is the AXI bus.
